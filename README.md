# -CMPG-323-Overview-35482737
My 2022 individual assignment for enhancing skills across different concepts, tools and technology stacks.

## -Repositories to be created and used for each project 
There are 6 milestones to be reached therefore each project milestone will have a repository that will handle and keep track of files worked on.
Repository: Project 1(CMPG-323-Overview-35482737)
Repository: Project 2(API developments)
Repository: Project 3(Standards and patterns)
Repository: Project 4(Testing and RPA)
Repository: Project 5(Reporting and Monitoring)
Repository: POE(Portfolio of evidence)

### -Project structure for semester
There is 1 project created which will include multiple sub branches and repositories. 

#### -Branching strategy 
Each project/milestone will be attend through the use of a braunch to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas.
This is done to protect the main branch ofthe project.
After successfuly working on the individual branches they will be added to the main.

##### -Use of .gitignore file
gitignore files will be utilised to prevent sensitive files and files containing pictures for project use hidden and not published publically.
There will be many more files that I will not want to commit on repositories so they will be hidden through .gitignore.

###### -How credentials will be stored?
Since passwords and sensitive credential will not be traditionally encrypted I will use a .git-credentials file that will store passwords and sensitive information in plain text format.
I will be able to access the information personally through my file system.

####### -How many repositories will be used to separate submissions?
1 repository per submision.

# Project 2 
An API was created which connected to a provided database. The API include various endpoint methods. I had to then ensure the API had sufficient security and authentication by limiting access to the API. Finally publishing and hosting of the API took place.

# Project 3 
Project 3 was focused on Standards and Patterns. Implementation of a Tier 2 repository design pattern ocured on a functional web application. The project initiated with connecting the web app to my hosted database. Then to implement the design pattern, repository classes were created to contain all data access operations for Zones, Categories and devices. I then had to implement the repository classes to their respective controllers. The final step was to host the application on azure and can be accessed through the url: https://project3-35482737.azurewebsites.net.

# Project 4
Project 4 was about Robotic Process Automation and Testing. This project was created using UIPath Studio. Excel data was provided to aid with the functionality of the project. A fullautomation process was created to read, write, update and delete data from the web application created in Project 3. The automation read data from the excel file into a UIPath datatable which would be referenced when writing to the different controllers. The process was then published to Uipath orchestrator.
