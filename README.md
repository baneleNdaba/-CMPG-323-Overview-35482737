# -CMPG-323-Overview-35482737
My 2022 individual assignment for enhancing skills across different concepts, tools and technology stacks.

## -Repositories to be created and used for each project 
There are 6 milestones to be reached therefore each project milestone will have a repository that will handle and keep track of files worked on.
Repository: Project 1(CMPG-323-Overview-35482737)
Repository: Project 2(API developments)
Repository: Project 3(Standards and patterns)
Repository: Project 4(Testing and RPA)
Repository: Project 5(Reporting and Monitoring)
Repository: POE(Portfolio of evidence)

### -Project structure for semester
There is 1 project created which will include multiple sub branches and repositories. 

#### -Branching strategy 
Each project/milestone will be attend through the use of a braunch to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas.
This is done to protect the main branch ofthe project.
After successfuly working on the individual branches they will be added to the main.

##### -Use of .gitignore file
gitignore files will be utilised to prevent sensitive files and files containing pictures for project use hidden and not published publically.
There will be many more files that I will not want to commit on repositories so they will be hidden through .gitignore.

###### -How credentials will be stored?
Since passwords and sensitive credential will not be traditionally encrypted I will use a .git-credentials file that will store passwords and sensitive information in plain text format.
I will be able to access the information personally through my file system.

####### -How many repositories will be used to separate submissions?
1 repository per submision.
